        <h3>How do I delete tasks? Delete lists?</h3>

        <h3>What does the "Clear all Tasks!" button do?</h3>
        <h4>It clears all of the tasks across all lists on the page. Essentially it is a "Delete All!" button, and the changes made by it cannot be undone.</h4>

    <div>
        <h3>What does the "Save!" button do?</h3>
        <h4>It saves all your work; tasks, lists, and all. We highly reccomend you click it before exiting the page just to be sure everything is saved. However, we do currently have an early version of autosave that does save your work automatically.</h4>
